# barebones-openai-tools-chat
This is a barebones Python demo that showcases how to build a simple conversational agent (in terminal) using OpenAI's API with tool calling. The example includes basic math tools (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply` and `divide`) and focuses on clarity and simplicity â€” without relying on external frameworks or abstractions, just the core logic.
